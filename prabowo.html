He has been described as a right-wing nationalist.[2][3][4]</p>
        <p>Prabowo Subianto graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy (Akademi Militer Nasional) in 1970 and mostly served in the Special Forces (Kopassus) until he was appointed to lead the Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) in 1998.
