        <h1>Thank You!</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in supporting out Foundation. We are not fundraising in your country at this time, but monetary contributions are not your only option for donating to and supporting us.

            You don't need to apply or get special permission to join us. You don't even need to log in, although creating an account gives you more options and helps you keep track of your contributions. There is no central editorial board; all edits are made by individual members of the our community. For more information, please see the introduction.
            
            If you have any further questions regarding Wikipedia or editing, please contact info@webweb.org. This email address is answered by longtime project participants who have vast experience in this website related issues.
            
            Thanks again for your interest, and we hope you join us!</p>
